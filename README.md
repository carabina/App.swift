# App.swift

A bunch of components/code that I use frequently.

## Installation

### CocoaPods

[CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org) is a dependency manager for Cocoa projects. You can install it with the following command:

```bash
$ gem install cocoapods
```

To integrate App.swift into your Xcode project using CocoaPods, specify it in your `Podfile`:

```ruby
source 'https://github.com/CocoaPods/Specs.git'
target '<Your Target Name>' do
  pod 'App.swift', '~> 1.0'
end
```

Then, run the following command:

```bash
$ pod install
```

### Manually
Just drag and drop the files in the [Sources](Sources) folder.
